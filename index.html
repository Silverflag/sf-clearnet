        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 100%">
			Our organization is dedicated to defending digital rights, advocating for online privacy, and promoting freedom of expression. We strive to protect internet users from censorship and surveillance while advocating for policies that maintain an open and accessible internet for all. We also work to try and encourage the progress of open source software.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the goal</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 100%">
            We really like the thinking of the EFF foundation. Currently the internet is censored in many places, and others are surveilled. There is also the problem that many of the sites are doing things that do not benefit the users but benefit the corporation that is running them. We want to make the internet good for the end user and the people that it was built for. The internet can be used as a place for monetization, but at this point, it has been taken too far. We hate this new internet and want it to go back to being good. There is no good way to do that except to let people know when companies are doing shady things that need to be brought to the light. We hope that by using the SilverFlag website, you are able to have any more knowledge about bad practices from companies on the internet than you started with.
        </p>
        <h2>How are we going to do this?</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 100%">
            With anonymity tools, there are two types of people that are going to use them. The people that use them how we intend, and the people who will misuse them. The people that misuse them are the reasons that Tor has a bad reputation on the side of people who use it, and how many people think that it is only able to be used badly. Any tool, no matter its purpose, is able to be misused. We want to attempt to fix this, we are working on many ways with ideas on how this can be carried out while still keeping aspects like anonymity and not censoring our users. TLDR; Make a hammer that is only a hammer and not possibly used as a weapon.

			We also run some services that we encourage people to check out. We have a very basic self written chat application on https://chat.silverflag.net. We have a basic forum set up at https://forum.silverflag.net. We have some basic tools for people to be able to use at https://tools.silverflag.net. Most of these tools are still in development. If you would like to request features or report any bugs, you can use our forum. If anyone is interested in assisting with our project, people send a private message on our forum to ExplosiveManiac81 (Dreadâ€™s account) and he will reach out to you on what you can work on.
